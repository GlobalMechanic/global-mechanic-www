			p With a core staff of seasoned creatives and producers, we hub and spoke to handle projects small and large. That makes us nimble, adaptive, and it saves us from getting set in our ways. It’s a studio culture of invention and collaboration, where change is expected. Welcome even. 
			p It shows in our work. We love what we do, for big ad agencies and clients like Leo Burnett, Grey, Ogilvy, BBDO, Coca-Cola, BMW, P&G, Nestlé, and Bell, for broadcasters like PBS, the Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon and CBC, the films we produce independently and in co-production with the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), our theatre and installation work and, of course, constant experimentation for the fun of it.
