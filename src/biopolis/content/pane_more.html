              <br>
              <p>will be 6 minutes long, with a hip-hop musical vibe to match the urban-interior setting. Our episodes will be simple and repetitive with story-beats that will become familiar to our viewers. We begin in the environment of the bone marrow with Liam drifting by—and we will see Liam interact with Blanche and May for a moment—and this is where we understand the emotional, pre-school issue that will be the theme of the episode.</p><br>
              <p>Once established, a medical threat or health problem will arrive that will challenge our core team of Blanche, Liam, and May. (“This could get weird!”) After some initial, comic missteps—and these missteps can connect to the theme of the episode—the team comes up with a plan to overcome the problem! (“But can we even do this?”)</p><br>
              <p>The situation twists with a complication, but Liam and Blanche and company, after applying the lesson learned from Blanche, resolve the complication. This will not be scary so much as fulfilling—and the challenge-overcoming sequence in each episode will be done as a song and music montage, with our hero characters performing in a music video-like sequence as they solve and overcome the threat to Chloe. Each episode’s music sequence will feature a hip-hop take on a different musical style, everything from K-Pop to Be-bop, Calypso to Polka to Cow-Punk.</p><br>
              <p>The problem solved, the team returns to normal, and there is a grace note between Liam and May that refers to the episode’s theme and ends the story on an upbeat as we hear a reprise of the episode’s song.</p><br>

              <h2 class="biopolis_episode_title">Soccer Game</h2>
              <div class="biopolis_episode_writeup">
                <p>Chloe leaves the house—she’s off to play a soccer game! We hear her mother warn her about what happened last time. Whoa—was it a soccer injury? Sort of. Chloe sat on the bench all game, pulled off a hang-nail and it got infected...</p><br>
                <p>Inside Chloe’s body, Blanche is monitoring the hang-nail situation—she needs more white blood cells for the infection and she wishes Chloe would eat a carrot once in a while instead of candy—these new fat cells are making it hard to do the job. Where’s Liam anyway? May looks to one side ... and Liam appears. He apologizes—he was making friends with these other red blood cells when he should’ve been paying attention! He’s really sorry! No need to freak, says Blanche. It’s always good to make new friends. But pay attention now, okay? First things first. We need to make more white blood cells—in the bone marrow close to the infection. To the finger bones! Let’s move it!</p><br>
                <p>“Let’s move it!” screams Chloe’s soccer coach. When a kid comes off the field after sprinting and feeling faint, Chloe comes off the bench and gets into the game. But trying to stop a break-away, Chloe falls, breaking her finger!</p><br>
                <p>Inside, Liam and May are freaking out. How can the bone marrow produce blood cells when it’s broken? Blood cells are scattering everywhere! We got new priorities, says Blanche. In order to heal the broken bone, inflammation is the way to go. We need reinforcements and new recruits. Any ideas? May looks at Liam, tugs on his face, and looks to one side. Of course, says Liam. My new friends!</p><br>
                <p>MUSIC MONTAGE SEQUENCE: To a Rawhide-like cattle round-up song, Liam and May and Blanche recruit dozens and dozens, and then hundreds of hundreds, of blood cells to clot around the fracture to help hold the bone in place and to prevent further blood loss.</p><br>
                <p>As the song ends, Blanche thanks May and Liam for paying attention. Working together, they did this! Liam beams, feeling happy that his new friends were a help. Maybe he’s going to make it after all. And Chloe’s broken finger is on the mend!</p><br>
                <p>Yup, it’s on the mend and we see the finger in a splint and taped to the middle finger ... as Chloe, in the car following the soccer game, reaches, not for an apple or carrot, but a chocolate bar. Doh!</p><br>

              <h2 class="biopolis_episode_title">Chloe’s Sleep-over</h2>
              <div class="biopolis_episode_writeup">
                <p>As Chloe greets her BFF for a sleepover, inside the body Liam is freaking out by all the bacteria everywhere. “100 trillion microbes? That’s like ten times the amount of human cells—that means most of the stuff inside is not even human at all! We’re out-numbered! This isn’t going to work!” Blanche tells him to relax. The bacteria are much smaller and only make up about one or two per cent of the total body mass. And besides, some bacteria is good bacteria. Life isn’t always what you think. And good bacteria comes in handy when Chloe stays up too late and eats too much popcorn and gets gas—what really causes all the farting and diarrhea? And how much did she eat anyway? Because now a lot of that popcorn—and a large group of good bacteria—will be exiting her body as waste. Liam and May must say goodbye to some of their bacterial friends as Liam reflects, Wow, life isn’t always what you think...</p><br>

              <h1 class="biopolis_writeup_title">Visual & Musical Identity</h1>
              <div class="biopolis_episode_writeup">
                <br><p>Sounds</p>
                <p>The human world will be full of the everyday noises of human life—the family’s voices, the snap of the dad’s briefcase, the click of the mom’s cell phone—but we won’t be seeing much of them.
                Music</p><br>
                <p>Biopolis will have a very worked-out musical identity, from the opening theme song to musical SFX to the song featured in the middle of each episode. The sounds of the body are their own symphony, of course, and we will be enhancing it Fantasia-like. Hiphop will define the show, with musical numbers within the show: hiphop mash-ups of other styles, as if a smart house band is adapting everything to their preferred style.</p><br>
                <p>Visuals</p>
                <p>Shooting style will be simple, with clear compositions, simple camera movements, and with occasional forays into subjective perspective, a blood cell’s bird’s-eye-view view, like when Liam’s shadowing a phagocyte who’s chasing down a particularly unruly pathogen. Views of Chloe and her world will be pretty tight to her and whatever she’s doing. Inside will be the inevitable fly through tubes to get to microscopic scale, then drifty floaty camera in a fluid world. There will be sporadic action-y scenes, our version of a car chase or ninja fight or parkour sequence or escape-from-dungeon, because little kids, even-pre-schoolers, are watching their older siblings play Grand Theft Auto or Kung Fu Panda and want to join in.</p><br><br>
